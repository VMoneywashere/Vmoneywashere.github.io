                <p>My name is Vincent this is a website that I was forced write and code. I'm currently in Grade nine and I'm doing coding as a sort of Hobby
                Other things I do has hobbies includes drawing, gaming, and Air Cadets (the latter is something where i was forced to do).
                </p>
                <p> Most of my experience come from educational or extra curricular educationas activites. This includes basketball (school based), Air Cadets (out of school)
                    chinese lessons(out of school), badminton(in and out of school), cooking(mostly in school), outdoor education trips( in school), and coding( mostly out of school).
                </p>
                <p>I am curerently a student of Fraser Academy which is located in kitsolano, Vancouver. I used to be at Maple GRove Elemantary but I wasn't able to catch up with my fellow peers at the time so 
                    I was moved to Fraser and spent five years there. I may potientaly move to Magie Secendary so I may end up betraying my friends.
