                    I am curerently a student of Fraser Academy which is located in kitsolano, Vancouver. I used to be at Maple GRove Elemantary but I required learning assitance so 
                    I was moved to Fraser and spent five years there. I may potientaly move to Magie Secendary so I may end up betraying my friends.
